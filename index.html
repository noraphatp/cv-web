					<h4>Technical skills</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I have acquired a fundamental knowledge of programming through the
							University programme and web development basics through personal
							stuides.
						</li>
						<li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Work experience</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Nabla Digital | July 2018 - I created a mario game in a platform
							called Unity using C# for code and photoshop to design
							backgrounds. This was also where I first learned about HTML and
							CSS, developing a simple clone of the Google page
						</li>
						<li>
							Group Maker | August 2020 - I created a coded a simple version of
							the Robot AGV, a robot car which turns into the direction of
							shadows to avoid collisions (Arduino)
						</li>

				<h4>Projects and courses</h4>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">Workify (Group project)</p>
					<p>
						We created a web application that allows users to track their
						productivity based on their music listening habits. The application
						uses the Spotify API to retrieve the user's listening history and
						the results are displayed using graphs. My main contribution to the
						project was the implementation of the web app's functionality using
						JavaScript.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">HTML and CSS fundatmentals (Individual learning)</p>
					<p>
						I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS through a course on Udemy called 
						"Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
						This one of the first courses I took to learn web development, as I was interested
						in creating websites and to adopt a more creative approach to programming. I have
						gained a lot of experience while coding alongside the instructor.
					</p>
				</div>		
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">
						Tic tac toe using React JS (Individual)
					</p>
					<p>
						A simple Tic Tac Toe game created using React JS. The game is played
						locally with two players, and the winner automatically determined
						when a player wins or the game ends in a draw. I did this project to 
						practice React JS for my Experimental Systems Project.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">
						Sudoku solver in Python (Individual coursework)
					</p>
					<p>
						A program wihch solves sudoku boards at an efficient rate using a
						backtracking algorithm with constraint satisfaction.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">
						Dice game AI (Individual coursework)
					</p>
					<p>
						I implemented an AI for a dice game using the value iteration algorithm.
						The AI is able to play the game at a high level, and consistently achieve 
						very high scores.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">
						Visual computing (Individual coursework)
					</p>
					<p>
						This coursework is done in Python using the numpy library. The coursework involves the implementation of
						many algorithms and techniques in computer vision such as De Casteljau's algorithm, Fourier transform etc. 
						The project is split into 4 notebooks: Convolutions, transformations, image warping and Bezier curves. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="project-box-subheader">
						Slingo (2nd year Experimental Systems Project)
					</p>
					<p>
						We made a sign language translator using tensorflow and React JS for the front-end. In this project
						my main contribution was the implementation of the whole front-end and supporting the machine learning
						team. The project's core functionality is working smoothly with a professional looking front-end. We 
						are still further developing the project to add extra features.
